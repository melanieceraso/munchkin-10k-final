# munchkin Track-o-Matic

Munchkin is a multi-themed card game created by Steve Jackson Games.   Often at a loss for d10s or paper, we wanted a way to track character levels and do a little bit of math necessary to beat all the monsters your buddies throw at you to keep you from reaching level 10.  While there exists a Munchkin app, it is a bit of a resource hog and so we challenged ourselves to write something better and your contest provided the catalyst for a starting point which we hope to continue evolving.

Originally created for the 2016 A List Apart 10k competition, I am revisiting it and doing minor enhancements as part of my participation in Hacktoberfest 2019.
